## Overview  
This project focuses on helping **Atliquo Bank**, a new entrant in Indiaâ€™s banking sector, strategize the launch of their credit card in a competitive market dominated by established players like Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank. The project leverages **data science** and **financial analytics** to identify target customer segments, optimize credit card features, and validate strategies through A/B testing.

## Objectives  
1. Identify the ideal target audience for the new credit card based on customer demographics and spending habits.  
2. Design and validate credit card features using data-driven techniques.  
3. Provide actionable insights through an interactive dashboard for business strategy.  

## Phases of the Project  

### **Phase 1: Identifying the Target Market**  
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Handled null values and treated duplicates.  
  - Detected and resolved outliers using statistical techniques such as normal distribution and measures of central tendency/dispersion.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Conducted in-depth analysis of customer, transaction, and credit history datasets.  
  - Visualized customer demographics, spending patterns, and credit usage.  
- **Outcome:**  
  - Identified key customer segments for targeting the credit card launch (e.g., by age, occupation, and income levels).  

### **Phase 2: Product Testing through A/B Testing**  
- **Trial Run:**  
  - Conducted a small-scale trial using random sampling.  
  - Determined sample size for A/B testing based on statistical power and effect size.  
- **Hypothesis Testing:**   
  - figured out the number of customers needed based on statiscal power and effective size which are agreed upon after discussing with business
  - Formed control and test groups for the trial. 
  - Performed a **Two-Sample Z-Test** to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed credit card features.  

## Tools and Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels  
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Statistical Methods:** Central Limit theroem, Z test, A/B testing, Normal distribution,Statiscal power and effective size.  

## Key Insights  
1. Clear segmentation of the target audience helps tailor credit card features.  
2. Spending patterns and income levels play a critical role in designing effective rewards programs.  
3. Data-driven validation ensures better decision-making and reduces risks in product launch strategies.  

## Deliverables  
1. Cleaned and preprocessed datasets.  
2. Detailed analysis and visualizations highlighting key findings.
